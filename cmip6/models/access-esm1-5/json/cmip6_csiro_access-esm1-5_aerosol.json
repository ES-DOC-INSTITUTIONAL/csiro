                "Emissions for the sulphur cycle include emissions of ammonium sulphate aerosol precursors: sulphur dioxide and dimethylsulphide. For sulphur dioxide, anthropogenic emissions are split into surface and chimney-level emissions. Natural emissions from volcanoes are provided as a 3D field. DMS emissions are provided by the ocean biogeochemistry scheme over the ocean, and provided through a dataset over land surfaces. All sulphur-cycle emissions are expressed in term of mass of sulphur within the model. For black-carbon and organic-carbon aerosols from fossil-fuel and biofuel emissions, emissions are provided at near-surface level. These emissions are expressed in term of mass of carbon. For biomass-burning aerosol, emissions are provided as two fields: surface emissions, and high-level emissions. The latter field is homogeneously distributed across the boundary layer. Biomass emissions are expressed in term of mass of carbon. Emissions for sea-salt and mineral dust aerosols are computed interactively from the modelled meteorology and soil properties by their respective schemes. The climatology of monthly-averaged mass-mixing ratios of secondary organic aerosol from terpene emissions was derived from the chemistry-transport model STOCHEM (Derwent et al., 2003). 2D emissions: All emission fields are provided as monthly means, which are time interpolated by the model every 5 days. Sulphur dioxide emissions are derived from sector-based emissions datasets for IPCC AR5 (Lamarque et al., 2009). Emissions for all sectors are considered surface emissions, except for energy emissions and half of industrial emissions which are considered chimney-level emissions. Emissions for land-based dimethylsulphide are taken from Spiro et al. (1992). Anthropogenic emissions for black carbon and organic carbon are from the sum of all sector-based emissions in the IPCC AR5 dataset. They are emitted in the second level of the model (near-surface emissions). Anthropogenic emissions for biomass-burning aerosol are the sum of IPCC AR5 emissions for black and organic carbon from biomass-burning emissions. Grass fire emissions are assumed to be surface emissions, while forest fire emissions are distributed homogeneously across the boundary layer. Emissions based on interactive schemes: Sea-salt and mineral dust aerosol emissions are computed interactively depending on modelled near-surface wind speeds and soil properties (Jones et al., 2001; Woodward, 2001). The only 3D aerosol-related emissions used in the model are natural emissions of sulphur dioxide from background volcanoes (Andres and Kasgnoc, 1998). Aircraft emissions of aerosol precursors or primary [aerosols] are not included in the model."

The longwave band from 1200 to 1500 cm-1 has been split at 1330 cm-1 in order to better represent the overlap between CH4 and N2O. Gaseous absorption is based on the updated High-Resolution Transmission (HITRAN) 2000 database (Rothman et al., 2003). The water vapour continuum is version 2.4 of the Clough-Kneizys-Davies (CKD) formulation (Clough et al., 1992) and has been included in the shortwave region. Treatment of the effects of non-spherical ice cloud particles are determined using the parameterization by Kristjansson et al. (2000). The sea surface albedo is based on the functional form of Barker and Li (1995), modified in the light of aircraft data, and the land-surface albedo is described by Essery et al. (2003).

                "The model includes interactive schemes for sulphate, sea salt, black carbon from fossil-fuel emissions, organic carbon from fossil-fuel emissions, mineral dust, and biomass-burning aerosols. The model also includes a fixed monthly climatology of mass-mixing ratios of secondary organic aerosols from terpene emissions (biogenic aerosols). All aerosol species, except sea-salt and biogenic aerosols, are advected using the tracer advection scheme and undergo wet and dry deposition. Wet deposition accounts for re-evaporation of precipitation (Bellouin et al., 2007). All aerosol species exert a direct effect (scattering and absorption of shortwave and longwave radiation) and thereby also a semi-direct effect (impact on atmospheric temperature and cloud profiles of aerosol absorption). All aerosol species, except black carbon and mineral dust, also contribute to both the first and second indirect effects on clouds, modifying cloud albedo and precipitation efficiency, respectively. The version of the sulphur cycle is described in Jones et al. [2001] and Roberts and Jones [2004] with further improvements described hereafter. The sulphate scheme is a modal scheme where the free aerosol is assumed to have a log-normal size distribution in the Aitken and accumulation size ranges, which include particles with a radius less than 0.05 and 0.5 m, respectively. Sulphate aerosol may also be in a dissolved mode where layer clouds are present, thus affecting the cloud droplet size and exerting first and second indirect effects (modification of cloud albedo and precipitation efficiency, respectively). The sulphur cycle also includes improvements described by Bellouin et al. [2007]: condensation of sulphuric acid from dry oxidation of sulphur dioxide and dimethysulphide, and conversion from Aitken to accumulation mode particles by condensation. In addition, the oxidation of SO2 and DMS is now using oxidant concentrations (OH, HO2, H2O2, O3) provided by ancillary files. Emissions of dimethylsulphide from the ocean are calculated from the concentration of DMS in seawater (provided by an ancillary file), surface windspeed and sea-surface temperature. The sea salt scheme is a simple diagnostic scheme depending on wind speed and height above the surface to determine the number concentration of sea salt particles in two size modes (Jones et al., 2001). Schemes for black carbon from fossil-fuel emissions (Roberts and Jones, 2004), biomass-burning, and organic carbon from fossil-fuel emissions (Collins et al, 2008) include modes for freshly emitted particles that gradually age into another, more hygroscopic mode; there is also a mode for aerosols that have become incorporated into cloud droplets. Black carbon is considered to be slightly hygroscopic, only becoming incorporated into cloud droplets by diffusion, whereas organic carbon and biomass-burning aerosols are considered to act as cloud condensation nuclei. The mineral dust scheme is based on Woodward (2001) with revisions described by Bellouin et al. (2007).  Emissions are computed interactively and depend on vegetation fraction, soil roughness length and moisture, and near surface wind speeds. The modelled horizontal flux is calculated for nine size bins covering particle radii from  0.0316 to 1000 microns.  The vertical flux into the atmosphere is obtained from the horizontal flux and partitioned across six size bins, covering radii from 0.0316 to 31.6 microns. These six size bins are then transported and experience deposition through gravitational settling, turbulent mixing, and below cloud scavenging."
